// Update 1

Overhauled the Agency Bootstrap theme to achieve a basic, but still modern looking homepage.


// Update 2

Implemented MailChimp for an e-mail system so that interested users may stay up-to-date with any major changes or developments with the app.


// Update 3

Added Google Analytics support to monitor website performance.



// Update 4

Wufoo Form Builder was finally added to allow for user-registration in a very simplistic manner. Only supports 100 registrations per month on the free version, so a larger scale app will need to upgrade or develop their own system.
